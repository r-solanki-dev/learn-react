1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
   Returns an array that applies a callback function to every element in the array.


2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
   To render a re-useable element dynamically for each element in an array.



3. Critical thinking: why is using `.map()` better than just
   creating the components manually by typing them out?
   It allows the data to scale without requiring the code to change.
